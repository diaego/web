This customization will cycle a list of words, fixed to the center of the screen, with each word rendered as large as possible. To use, first add the following script to your Custom HTML:

<script src="https://static.cargo.site/scripts/loader.js" data-name="cycle"></script>

Then paste this code into the CSS Editor:

.cycle_content {
    opacity: 0;
    white-space: nowrap;
    display: inline-block;
    pointer-events: none;
}
 
.cycle_container {
    position: fixed;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    font-size: 1rem;
    line-height: 1 !important;
}


Then edit the page where you want to add your cycling text, open Code View (via the Formatting Toolbar) and paste the following div:

<div on-time="400" off-time="0" size="90%" random="false" loop="true" class="cycle">COMPACT DISCS FOR EVERY ONE</div>

Each word will be displayed on its own; to display multiple words together, replace spaces with &nbsp;

on-time The length of time (in milliseconds) to display each word
off-time The length of time (in milliseconds) between displaying each word
size The size of the text / the percentage of the browser's width to occupy.
To make all text the same size, use a “rem” value (e.g. 4rem).

random Whether to randomize the words every cycle
loop Whether to display the cycle repeatedly.
