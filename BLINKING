Open Code View while editing a page and wrap your element or text with a div that has the class ‘blink’.<div class="blink">Blinking Text</div> 

Open the CSS Editor and paste in the following code:
.blink {
    animation: 1s infinite blink;
    display: inline-block;
}

@keyframes blink {
    0%, 15% {
        opacity: 0;
    }
    16%, 100% {
        opacity: 1;
    }
}

To alter the speed, adjust the 1s attribute in the animation property.

To create the same effect on hover, replace the .blink rule with the following CSS: 
.blink:hover {
    animation: 1s infinite blink;
    display: inline-block;
}
